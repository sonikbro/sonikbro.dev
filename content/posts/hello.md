Hi! I’m Anatolii Melnyk, a Software Developer from Ukraine.

👋 About me: I know Frontend and UI/UX, I love React and TypeScript. I like to find solutions to complex problems that will help other people. I quickly adapt to new technologies and communicate well with people.

👨‍💻 I work remotely at Luxoft. I shift data into objects and write code for the enterprise. I have been a professional developer since 2019. During this time, I learned to find a common language with people in the team, defend my point of view and be open to others.

🇺🇦 I was born in western Ukraine but moved to Kyiv in 2015 when I entered the university and started studying Computer Science.

🕺 I love watching movies and telling why mechanical keyboards are cool! I love swapping icons and apps on my computer. I live in tables and lists, and I constantly buy something for a smart home.

⛺ In my free time I do hiking and listen to podcasts (I have been listening to them since 2012…). I love parties with tents and hiking in the mountains. I also like board games and computer games. I have been devoting little time to games lately, I like to read and watch the processes of their development and game design more.

_Stay tuned ;)_
